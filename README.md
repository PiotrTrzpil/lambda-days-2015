Info and insight gathered on LambdaDays 2015

LambdaDays, the functional programming conference in Cracow, with 3 tracks and lots of interesting people.
It was in fact a more functional first day + reactive second day.

The conference was opened by keynote given by Garrett Smith from CloudBees. With some technical difficulties, the talk was streamed to the second hall due to overcrowding. Garrett talked about functional programming in general, giving some interesting patterns found in it. Overall, it was quite motivating start.

Then, I decided to begin with the research track. Professor Kevin Hammon gave there a very enthusiastic talk on megacore computing, being a philosophical upgrade over multicore and happening in the near future. Functional programming will make grasping it a reality, bringing unlimited parallelism and abscracting over the processing units executing it, whether CPU or GPU. Although actor model was skipped and unheard of completely, this was overall a pretty insightful talk, promoting the http://www.paraphrase-ict.eu project.
